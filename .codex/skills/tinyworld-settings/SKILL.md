# Tiny World Settings

Keep settings changes compatible with the existing static single-file app:

- Preserve `data-settings-tab` values (`app`, `rendering`, `world`, `materials`, `environment`, `crowd`, `ai`) unless every command-palette and settings caller is updated in the same change.
- Preserve existing control IDs. The settings setup code binds controls by `getElementById`, so moving controls between sections is safe but renaming IDs is not.
- `selectSettingsTab(name)` must guard unknown names and update all tab and panel state together: `.active`, `aria-selected`, tab `tabIndex`, panel `.active`, and panel `hidden`.
- Settings tabs should remain real `role="tab"` buttons inside a `role="tablist"` and support click plus Arrow/Home/End keyboard navigation.
- Panels should be `role="tabpanel"` with stable IDs and `aria-labelledby` pointing at the matching tab.
- Settings search should be a thin UI layer over the existing tab/panel wiring: never rename controls for search, keep hidden rows reversible when the query clears, and route automatic tab changes through `selectSettingsTab()`.
- Search result counts may be shown inside tab buttons, but keep the tab's `data-settings-tab` value, `role`, keyboard navigation, and accessible label in sync.

Organization guidance:

- Rendering: keep image/render-cost controls grouped by intent. `Quality` covers resolution and shadows; `Lighting` covers lighting and fill controls; `Image effects` covers brightness, saturation, contrast, pixelation, shader AA, and tilt-shift.
- World: keep `Preview` controls separate from `Terrain style` controls. Preview covers distance/window/opacity; terrain style covers voxel gap/bevel, landscape/planet toggles, voxel/cottage/crowns, and terrain voxel resolution.
- Materials, Environment, Crowd, and AI can be improved independently, but keep their current control IDs and listener wiring intact.

Validation:

- Run the inline script syntax check, `npm test`, and `npm run build`.
- Browser-check Settings opens, every tab can be selected, only one panel is visible, search routes to matching sections and clears cleanly, Arrow/Home/End navigation works, command-palette-style tab clicks still work, and the console has no app errors.
